**Unit 8: Cell Division** <span id="8"></span> 

*Almost all living cells have the ability to divide and form two new
cells. Depending on the function of the mother cell, the new cells can
be either exact replicas of the original cell or unique new ones.
Mitosis is the process by which a cell creates an exact replica of
itself; it occurs a countless number of times in living organisms. In
fact, because of mitosis, most of the cells in your body are no more
than a few months old, regardless of how old you are. Meiosis, on the
other hand, is the process by which the mother cell creates uniquely new
cells. It only takes place in reproductive cells, such as sperm cells or
egg cells. This process explains why you are not an exact replica of
your parents and is the reason why humans are as diverse as they are. It
might be useful to think of mitosis as the cellular counterpart to DNA
replication and meiosis as the counterpart to DNA recombination.*

     Instructions: Watch this animation to visually distinguish between
    the individual steps of mitosis. After watching the animation, take
    the quiz to gauge how well you have learned the material. Keep in
    mind that mitosis is associated with the cell division of
    non-gamete-forming cells (somatic cells). It occurs in unicellular
    organisms when they are cloning themselves or in cell division of
    somatic cells during growth of multicellular organisms.

     Instructions: Watch this animation to visually distinguish between
    the individual steps of meiosis I. Please also take the quiz
    following the animation. In Prophase I, genes from the mother and
    father strands recombine to create a new and unique DNA strand.
    Think back to DNA recombination. Additionally, meiosis is associated
    with cell division of gamete-forming cells (egg- or sperm-forming
    cells). Meiosis occurs in animals’ ovaries and testicles and in
    plants’ ovaries and anther. Pay attention to how mitosis differs
    from meiosis.
