**Unit 7: Molecular Genetics** <span id="7"></span> 

*We will now turn to the molecular aspect of genetics, the field of
biology that studies how we pass on our genes (DNA). Simply put, two
processes enable us to pass along our genes: DNA replication (which
produces an exact copy of the original cell) and DNA recombination
(which creates a unique new cell from the mother cell). Recombination is
the molecular mechanism that creates diversity amongst life forms. Both
replication and recombination are comprised of a complex series of
reactions that involve the parent DNA strands. More information on this
topic is discussed in the genetics course.*

     Instructions: Read the “Transformation,” “Transduction,” and
    “Conjugation” sections for an overview of these genetic exchange
    methods. Bacteria use these three separate methods in order to
    obtain new pieces of genetic information. These methods help
    bacterial cells overcome their inability to genetically recombine
    via sexual reproduction, a process that only occurs in eukaryotic
    cells. Scientists have learned how to use these methods to their
    advantage in the laboratory; this is how they introduce new genes to
    bacteria.
