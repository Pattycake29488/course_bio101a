**Unit 5: Central Dogma of Molecular Biology** <span id="5"></span> 

*Francis Crick (one of the scientists that shared the Nobel Prize for
discovering the double-helix nature of DNA) first coined the term
“central dogma” of molecular biology in 1958 to describe one of the most
important pathways in biology. This theory states that the information
for life flows in a single direction – from genes (DNA) to RNA to
protein – and that, in effect, DNA contains the information for life and
creates diversity in life. This discovery has fueled much of the
biomedical research that has taken place over the past few decades. It
has led us to invest billions of dollars in the Human Genome Project (a
project that aims to identify every single human gene) and sparked the
biotechnology industry, which enabled us to transplant genes from one
organism to another and create glow-in-the-dark mice, among other
things. (This unit is covered in great detail in* [*BIO311: Molecular
Biology*](http://www.saylor.org/courses/bio311/)*, if you want to learn
more about it.)*

**5.1 The Central Dogma of Molecular Biology** <span id="5.1"></span> 
*Note: The Central Dogma of Molecular Biology is one of the most
important topics in molecular biology! Please don’t be confused by the
titles of the resources in this subunit. “The Central Dogma of Molecular
Biology” is called “The Central Dogma of Biochemistry” and “The Central
Dogma of Biology” by different sources. However, all these names refer
to the same dogma.*

    sequence. Note that this resource is called the “Central Dogma of
    Biology.” The next resource uses the title “Central Dogma of
    Biochemistry.” Both refer to the same dogma and important molecular
    biology concept.
